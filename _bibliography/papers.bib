  abstract = {A non-trivial symbolic machinery is presented that can rephrase algorithmically a finite set of nested hypergeometric products in appropriately designed difference rings. As a consequence, one obtains an alternative representation in terms of one single product defined over a root of unity and nested hypergeometric products which are algebraically independent among each other. In particular, one can solve the zero-recognition problem: the input expression of nested hypergeometric products evaluates to zero if and only if the output expression is the zero expression. Combined with available symbolic summation algorithms in the setting of difference rings, one obtains a general machinery that can represent (and simplify) nested sums defined over nested products.}
