  abstract = {With the increasing complexity of gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes, data-driven approaches for monitoring and understanding automated GMAW production lines are gaining increased prominence. In this work, welding process data recorded in a production environment is analysed using unsupervised learning methods. We describe a data processing pipeline for feature engineering and apply a state-of-the-art clustering method to gain more insights into the welding production process. The clustering results are compared with the results from the application of dimensional reduction techniques and discussed based on human-interpretable characteristics of the welding process.},

  abstract = {Amidst the advent of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing industry is exploring AI methodologies and other data-driven approaches for the understanding and optimization of gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes. Various data sources such as process data logs and image data are available to the users of modern welding systems. However, to make good use of the data for machine learning, data sets of different quality and information density have to be fused. In this paper, we propose strategies for improving the dataset quality of time series process data and image data from the GMAW process.  We explore resampling strategies to ensure the harmonization of time series data. Additionally, ideas for improving image quality from welding process cameras are discussed.},

  abstract = {A non-trivial symbolic machinery is presented that can rephrase algorithmically a finite set of nested hypergeometric products in appropriately designed difference rings. As a consequence, one obtains an alternative representation in terms of one single product defined over a root of unity and nested hypergeometric products which are algebraically independent among each other. In particular, one can solve the zero-recognition problem: the input expression of nested hypergeometric products evaluates to zero if and only if the output expression is the zero expression. Combined with available symbolic summation algorithms in the setting of difference rings, one obtains a general machinery that can represent (and simplify) nested sums defined over nested products.},
